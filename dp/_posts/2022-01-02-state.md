# Goal  
 - This pattern is used when we need to change an object's behaviors base on its current state. In this definition two separate cases can be considered:  
    - The one that current state does not change by any behavior.   
    - The one that current state changes based on performed behavior, like what we called state-transition diagram. In this case, every action should change current state of an onject, so every behavior should have access to current state.
    we need both cases here

## Case A
- The one that current state does not change by any behavior. Here we called it `unchangeable`

### Real World Example
 - In operating systems, each of keyboard's key can act differently based on current application user works with it, so a key can act differently on different states. In problems with this situation **state pattern** can be a solution.

### Implementation
 - Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/amohtashami/DesignPatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/io/github/aliehmohtashami/behavioral/state/unchangeable)


### Notes
 - No dependency is needed between State and Context

## Case B
- The one that current state changes based on performed behavior. ere we called it `changeable`

### Real World Example
 - Suppose we have a TV with two buttons on it, off/on button and mute/unmute button. by pressing each button at each TV state, we reach to a new state. We can visualize it by this state-transition diagram

### Implementation
 - Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/amohtashami/DesignPatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/io/github/aliehmohtashami/behavioral/state/changeable)


### Notes
 - Note to **use** relationship between State and Context.
