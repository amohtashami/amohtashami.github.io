## Goal
 - This pattern is used when we want to take a snapshot from an object's state, and restore a taken snapshot at future.
 
## Sample
 - Suppose we are developing a game, we want to let users save their playboard at any time, and load it  when they want. To do this we can use **memento pattern**.

## implementation
 - Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/amohtashami/DesignPatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/io/github/aliehmohtashami/behavioral/memento)


## Notes
 - Memento class can have all or some of Originator fields, so two different classes creates for them.
