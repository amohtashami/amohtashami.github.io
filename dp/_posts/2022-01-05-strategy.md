## Goal
 - This pattern is useful when we want to be able to choose `how` an action performed based on several different strategies.
 
## Real World Example
 - Suppose we create a diagram in an online website and we want to export it to an image and then save it. Exporting to an image can produce different formats (jpeg, png, pdf, etc). Also for saving environment, we can choose between local, google drive, dropbox, etc. Designing and implementing each of this two actions -exporting and saving- can be done more effective using **strategy pattern**.

## Implementation
 - Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/amohtashami/DesignPatterns/tree/master/src/main/java/io/github/aliehmohtashami/behavioral/strategy)


## Notes
 - In my example, I try to use more than one strategy pattern (one for export and one for save) in order to show how we can combine different strategies to get many different results from a single method. For example saving a JPEG in local, or saving a PDF in dropbox, or saving a JPEG in dropbox and many other cases.   
 - You may think `save` method should have an input argument or `export` method should have an output. It is true. Here my goal is to describe the concept of strategy pattern, so I do not envolve myself with details, but feel free to play with input/output arguments in real implementation for getting real results.  
 - I agree with you that Strategy pattern is very similar to State pattern, however they have some differences:
    - In `Strategy interface` we only have one single method, but in `State interface` we can have several methods.
    - In diagram, pay attention to `Context` class, it has **no aggrigation relationship with strategy interface**, but this is **not true with state interface**.
