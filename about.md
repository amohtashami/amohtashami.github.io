My name is **Alieh Mohtashami** and I am a fan of most of fields in computer sciences! :)     
I have become acquainted with programming on high school when Pascal and Basic were two of well-known programming languages. Being interested in programming, I’ve decided to pursue my education in computer sciences. Several years later, I have completed my Master’s Degree in AI from university of Tehran.   
Currently, I work on Fanap Co. as a senior Java developer.    
I am also interested in `Math`, `Algorithm Design`, `AI` and `data sciences`.   
Last but not least, I’m very responsible, adaptive and always eager to learn new things. Recently, I have decided to record my scattered studies in order to share them with others and also return to them when needed.
